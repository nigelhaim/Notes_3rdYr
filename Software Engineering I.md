# Software Engineering Manual Notes 
### Software Engineering 1 and 2
**Prepared by: Asst. Prof. Mia V. Eleazar**

## Introduction 
- **Project based Learning(PBL)**
	- teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge" 
	- Course is designed using PBL 
	- Students are able to work collaboratively, engaging to 
		- Investigate 
		- reflect 
		- refine 
	- Basis lies on the authenticity or real-life application of the research begin done. 
	- Goa; : to create a living environment wherein students "learn by doing"


## Definition
- **System analysis**
	- The process of identifying an organization's purpose and goal in order to create a process or system which can help the organization achieve them. 
	- IT - Create automated systems which can help improve business productivity and achieve end-user efficiency. 
- **Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)**
	- Deals with the system development activities as mentioned in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230904160254.png]]
- **Agile Methods, Object-Oriented Approach (OOA)**
	- Built  incrementally and iteratively until the entire system is completed
- **Waterfall Method**
	- Uses a linear approach
	- Identifying -> Analyzing -> Plan designing -> Implementing by coding -> testing -> Verification -> Deployment
	- ##### Waterfall Model 
		- **Requirements Gathering**
			- The most important part
			- Stakeholder and customer requirements
			- Allowing every other phase to be executed based on the gathered requirements
		- **Requirement Analysis**
			- Gathered requirements are analyzed to check for consistency and redundancies.
			- Initial project scope is identified. 
			- No need to gather any other requirement  from the stakeholders and customers. 
		- **Design**
			- Categories
				- Logical Design 
					- When possible solutions are brainstormed  and theorized 
					- Project scope, functional and non-function requirements are identified. 
				- Physical Design
					- requirements are made into schemas and diagrams that can help visualize the project outcome. 
		- **Coding**
			- programmers analyze the requirements and specifications from the previous phases and produce actual code. 
		- **Testing**
			- Categories
				- Alpha testing
					- conducted by the system developers to check for errors and bugs prior to verification of end users
				- Beta Testing
		- **Verification and maintenance**
			- Also called beta testing
			- Customer uses the system to make sure that it meets the requirements
			- Customer uses the system during the maintenance phase, expected to discover bugs, inadequate features and other errors that may have been missed during Coding and Testing
			- The team should apply these fixes ad necessary until the customer is satisfied. 
		- **Software engineering**
			- involves the design and development of a software and how it can be managed.
			- Software design and development is implemented, including operation and maintenance. 
		
- **Overall**
	1. Project team needs to understand the organization
	2. Create a project proposal through research observation and actual interviews
	3. Succeeding phases (SDLC and OOA)
		- Both require extensive planning and use of diagrams for the design 
	- The Agile and DSLC approaches are both concerned about the way data is designed and processed throughout the system.

## Fishbone Diagram
- The root of the problem 
- Branching out
- Identifies and organizes the potential causes of a business problem 
- Uses an easy and understandable format 
- Identify the sources of process variation 
- Also called Ishikawa Diagram and Cause and Effect Diagram 
- Recognizes the potential causes of the business problem 
- Identify the hierarchy of causes including the possible root causes
- Attention to the primary factors affecting 

**Root causes are Normally**
- Those at the ends of chains of causes 
- Do not have any sub-causes
- ![[Pasted image 20230905155313.png]]

Often used during **brainstorming sessions** 
Everyone gains insight into the cause and effect 
This makes the solution easier to find later on 

#### Why are we doing this 
- Helps to create ideas about the possible causes of a problem before it happens
- Effective cause prevention tool
- Helps to identify the potential factors causing an effect to prevent future problems
- Can also be used in product design and to plan new processes 

### Process variables 
- Potential causes sometimes called the process input variables 
- Normally grouped into categories for easier sharing and reference 
- the 6M's
- **Man** - anyone involeved with the process and contributes to the effect 
- **Methods**- how the process is performed and the specific requirements for doing it, such as:
	- Policies 
		- The kind of data that might transform the system 
		- Like protection, authentication, and validity of every transaction in a banking system
	- Procedures 
		- The process of every transaction 
		- The step by step method 
	- Rules 
		- The requirements that SHOULD be reported in every transaction 
		- Provided that there are specific requirements that needs to be attained before every transaction 
	- Common Practices 
		- Laging ginagawa
**Machines**- Hardware used including the equipment and tools required to do the process 
**Materials**- Needed to produce the product or proviede the service
		- Raw materials
		- Parts
		- Papers
		- Packing 
		- Consumables
**Environment** - the conditions in which the process operates
**Measurements** - including the data that are used to evaluate the performance of the process

- Typical Fishbone Diagrams of manufacturing and non manufacturing processes
![[Pasted image 20230905161544.png]]


### How to construct a fishbone Diagram
- Clearly define the effect of the problem 
- Write it down at the center right of a large piece of paper
- Determine the major categories of causes 
- Write them down on the branches of the diagram 
- Use brainstorming to log all possible causes under the appropriate branches 
- Use 5 whys to search for root causes then add them to the diagram 
- Take time to ensure the appropriateness  the recorded information 
- Update the art as new causes become apparent 
- make of assign numbers near to the key causes t show their relative priority 
- Collect data and investigate to verify the key causes are actual 
- Plan and implement actions to address the key causes 
#### Ways of Finding more causes 
- Keep asking questions to encourage everyone to participate 
- Involve other people, especially those who have experience in the process
- Leave the chart on the wall for few days and encourage passers-by to contirbute
- Take a break or do something to take the team's mind off the current thoughts

### Further information 
- Different names may be used for the same category 
	- **Procedures** could be used instead of Methods
	- **equipment** could be used instead of machines
- You could also create sub categories
- Avoid writing real names of persons
- Beware of adding causes which are actually solutions
- A **Cause and Effect Matrix** could be used to prioritize the causes of the problem 
- Prioritizing and selectin the key causes will minimizes the need for more statistical evaluation of inputs that are unlikely to have an impact on the output.
