# Software Engineering Manual Notes 
### Software Engineering 1 and 2
**Prepared by: Asst. Prof. Mia V. Eleazar**

## Introduction 
- **Project based Learning(PBL)**
	- teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge" 
	- Course is designed using PBL 
	- Students are able to work collaboratively, engaging to 
		- Investigate 
		- reflect 
		- refine 
	- Basis lies on the authenticity or real-life application of the research begin done. 
	- Goa; : to create a living environment wherein students "learn by doing"


## Definition
- **System analysis**
	- The process of identifying an organization's purpose and goal in order to create a process or system which can help the organization achieve them. 
	- IT - Create automated systems which can help improve business productivity and achieve end-user efficiency. 
- **Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)**
	- Deals with the system development activities as mentioned in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230904160254.png]]
- **Agile Methods, Object-Oriented Approach (OOA)**
	- Built  incrementally and iteratively until the entire system is completed
- **Waterfall Method**
	- Uses a linear approach
	- Identifying -> Analyzing -> Plan designing -> Implementing by coding -> testing -> Verification -> Deployment
	- ##### Waterfall Model 
		- **Requirements Gathering**
			- The most important part
			- Stakeholder and customer requirements
			- Allowing every other phase to be executed based on the gathered requirements
		- **Requirement Analysis**
			- Gathered requirements are analyzed to check for consistency and redundancies.
			- Initial project scope is identified. 
			- No need to gather any other requirement  from the stakeholders and customers. 
		- **Design**
			- Categories
				- Logical Design 
					- When possible solutions are brainstormed  and theorized 
					- Project scope, functional and non-function requirements are identified. 
				- Physical Design
					- requirements are made into schemas and diagrams that can help visualize the project outcome. 
		- **Coding**
			- programmers analyze the requirements and specifications from the previous phases and produce actual code. 
		- **Testing**
			- Categories
				- Alpha testing
					- conducted by the system developers to check for errors and bugs prior to verification of end users
				- Beta Testing
		- **Verification and maintenance**
			- Also called beta testing
			- Customer uses the system to make sure that it meets the requirements
			- Customer uses the system during the maintenance phase, expected to discover bugs, inadequate features and other errors that may have been missed during Coding and Testing
			- The team should apply these fixes ad necessary until the customer is satisfied. 
		- **Software engineering**
			- involves the design and development of a software and how it can be managed.
			- Software design and development is implemented, including operation and maintenance. 
		
- **Overall**
	1. Project team needs to understand the organization
	2. Create a project proposal through research observation and actual interviews
	3. Succeeding phases (SDLC and OOA)
		- Both require extensive planning and use of diagrams for the design 
	- The Agile and DSLC approaches are both concerned about the way data is designed and processed throughout the system.

## Fishbone Diagram
- The root of the problem 
- Branching out
- Identifies and organizes the potential causes of a business problem 
- Uses an easy and understandable format 
- Identify the sources of process variation 
- Also called Ishikawa Diagram and Cause and Effect Diagram 
- Recognizes the potential causes of the business problem 
- Identify the hierarchy of causes including the possible root causes
- Attention to the primary factors affecting 

**Root causes are Normally**
- Those at the ends of chains of causes 
- Do not have any sub-causes
- ![[Pasted image 20230905155313.png]]

Often used during **brainstorming sessions** 
Everyone gains insight into the cause and effect 
This makes the solution easier to find later on 

#### Why are we doing this 
- Helps to create ideas about the possible causes of a problem before it happens
- Effective cause prevention tool
- Helps to identify the potential factors causing an effect to prevent future problems
- Can also be used in product design and to plan new processes 

### Process variables 
- Potential causes sometimes called the process input variables 
- Normally grouped into categories for easier sharing and reference 
- the 6M's
- **Man** - anyone involeved with the process and contributes to the effect 
- **Methods**- how the process is performed and the specific requirements for doing it, such as:
	- Policies 
		- The kind of data that might transform the system 
		- Like protection, authentication, and validity of every transaction in a banking system
	- Procedures 
		- The process of every transaction 
		- The step by step method 
	- Rules 
		- The requirements that SHOULD be reported in every transaction 
		- Provided that there are specific requirements that needs to be attained before every transaction 
	- Common Practices 
		- Laging ginagawa
**Machines**- Hardware used including the equipment and tools required to do the process 
**Materials**- Needed to produce the product or proviede the service
		- Raw materials
		- Parts
		- Papers
		- Packing 
		- Consumables
**Environment** - the conditions in which the process operates
**Measurements** - including the data that are used to evaluate the performance of the process

- Typical Fishbone Diagrams of manufacturing and non manufacturing processes
![[Pasted image 20230905161544.png]]


### How to construct a fishbone Diagram
- Clearly define the effect of the problem 
- Write it down at the center right of a large piece of paper
- Determine the major categories of causes 
- Write them down on the branches of the diagram 
- Use brainstorming to log all possible causes under the appropriate branches 
- Use 5 whys to search for root causes then add them to the diagram 
- Take time to ensure the appropriateness  the recorded information 
- Update the art as new causes become apparent 
- make of assign numbers near to the key causes t show their relative priority 
- Collect data and investigate to verify the key causes are actual 
- Plan and implement actions to address the key causes 
#### Ways of Finding more causes 
- Keep asking questions to encourage everyone to participate 
- Involve other people, especially those who have experience in the process
- Leave the chart on the wall for few days and encourage passers-by to contirbute
- Take a break or do something to take the team's mind off the current thoughts

### Further information 
- Different names may be used for the same category 
	- **Procedures** could be used instead of Methods
	- **equipment** could be used instead of machines
- You could also create sub categories
- Avoid writing real names of persons
- Beware of adding causes which are actually solutions
- A **Cause and Effect Matrix** could be used to prioritize the causes of the problem 
- Prioritizing and selectin the key causes will minimizes the need for more statistical evaluation of inputs that are unlikely to have an impact on the output.

## Project Methodologies
- **What is methodology**
	- Anyone who like to deploy products or services 
	- Multi-step approach to systems development 
	- Influences the quality of the Final product
	- Comprehensive 
		- All the components of methodology are considered as comprehensive 
		- All was discussed 
	- Consistent method with the organizations management style 


##### History of Methodology 
- Computer-based info systems begin in the 1950's
- 1980's introduced microcomputers 
	- CASE tools development 
		- Computer Aided Software Engineering tools development 
		- System developers wen from builders to integrations.
- 1990's brought systems integration
	- Visual programming environments
- Present day Info Systems 
	- Internet, Intranet, and Extranents

#### Waterfall Methodology 
- Overview
	- Introduced by W.W. Royce in 1970
	- It was later redesigned using a more 
- Phases
	- Requirements - data gathering 
		- Collected and set in stone 
	- Design - A blueprint is made for the programmers using the previously collected requirements 
	- Implementation - system components are designed by coders and integrated together
	- Testing - Integration the system is tested and bugs are removed 
	- Installation & Maintenance - The final installation of the system is done at this phase. Users are trained and the system is maintained by the system designers 

## Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Implementation 
	- System and Written specs turned over to programmers 
	- Implementation process
		- Coding, Testing, Installation
- Maintenance 
	- Systems are in operation
	- Specific problems or changes are made 
### Rapid Application Development (RAD)
**Overview**
- Methodology used to decrease time in development process
	- Efficient and Cheaper

## Different kinds of information systems 

### The pyramid model 

![[pyramid model.png]]
### Types of Information Processed at different levels

![[typesofinfomraion.jpg]]

### Common types of Information system in an organization
![[commontypes.png]]


1. ***Transaction Processing Systems***
	- operational-level systems at the bottom of the pyramid 
	- usually operated directly by the shop floor workers or front line staff, which provide the key data required to support the management of operations 
	- data is usually obtained through the automated or semi-automated tracking of low-level activities and basic transactions 
	- TPS are ultimatly little more than simple data a processing systems 
##### Functions of a TPS in terms of data processing 
| Inputs | Processing | Outputs|
|---|---|---|
|Transactions events | Validation, Sorting, Listing, Merging, Updating, Calculation | Lists, Detail reports, Action reports, Summary reports | 

##### Common types of Information System in an organization (contn)
**Some examples of TPS**
- Payroll systems
- Order processing systems
- Reservation systems
- Stock control systems
- Systems for payments and funds transfers 
**The role of TPS**
- Produce information for other systems 
- Cross boundaries (internal and external)
- Used by operational personnel + supervisory levels
- Efficiency oriented



2. ***Management Information systems***
	- For historical reasons, many of the different types of Information Systems found in commercial organizations are referred to as "Managment information systems
	- Management-level systems that are used by middle managers to help ensure the smooth running of the organization in the short to medium term 
	- The highly structured information provided by these systems allows managers to evaluate an organization's performance by comparing current with previous outputs 
	- MIS are built on the data provided by the TPS

##### Functions of a MIS in terms of data processing requirements 
| Inputs  | Processing  | Outputs | 
|---|---|---|
|Internal Transactions, Internal File's, Structured data | Sorting, Merging, Summarizing | Summary reports, Action reports, Detailed reports |

**Some examples of TPS**
- Payroll systems  
- Order processing systems  
- Reservation systems  
- Stock control systems  
- Systems for payments and funds transfers

**Role of TPS**
- Produce information for other systems  
- Cross boundaries (internal and external)  
- Used by operational personnel + supervisory levels  
- Efficiency oriented

3. ***Decision support systems***
- can be seen as a knowledge based system, used by senior managers, which facilitates the creation of knowledge and allow its integration into the organization
- These systems are often used to analyze existing structured information and allow managers to project the potential effects of their decisions into the future
- usually interactive and are used to solve ill structured problems
- offer access to databases, analytical tools, allow "what if" simulations, and may support the exchange of information within the organization.

##### Functions of a DSS
DSS manipulate and build upon the information from a MIS and/or TPS ato generate insithgts and new information 

|Inputs| Processing  | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
|Internal Transactions, Internal Files, External Information | Modelling, Simulation, Analysis, Summarizing | Summary reports, Forecasts, Graphs/Plots | 

**Some examples of DSS**  
- Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS)  
- Computer Supported Co-operative work (CSCW)  
- Logistics systems  
- Financial Planning systems  
- Spreadsheet Models?  
**The role of DSS**  
- Support ill- structured or semi-structured decisions  
- Have analytical and/or modelling capacity  
- Used by more senior managerial levels  
- Are concerned with predicting the future  
- Are effectiveness oriented?

5. ***Management Information systems***
- are strategic-level information systems that are found at the top of the Pyramid  
- help executives and senior managers analyze the environment in which the organization operates, to identify long-term trends, and to plan appropriate courses of action  
- information in such systems is often weakly structured and comes from both internal and external sources 
- Executive Information System are designed to be operated directly by executives without the need for intermediaries and easily tailored to the preferences of the individual using them

**Functions of an EIS**
EIS organizes and presents data and information from both external data  
sources and internal MIS or TPS in order to support and extend the inherent  
capabilities of senior executives.

|Inputs| Processing  | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
|External Data, Internal Files, Pre-defined models | Summarizing, Simulation, "Drilling Down" | Summary reports, Forecasts, Graphs/plots |\

**Some examples of EIS**
Executive Information Systems tend to be highly individualized and are often custom made for a particular client group; however, a number of off-the-shelf EIS packages do exist and many enterprise level systems offer a customizable EIS module.

**The role of EIS**
- Are concerned with ease of use  
- Are concerned with predicting the future  
- Are effectiveness oriented  
- Are highly flexible  
- Support unstructured decisions  
- Use internal and external data sources  
- Used only at the most senior management levels
