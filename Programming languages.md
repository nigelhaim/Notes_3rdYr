### Overview
Why studying programming languages 
- Increases our ability to express ideas
	- Increases capacity to use different constructs in writing programs
	- Enables us to have a bigger perspective 
- Enables to choose languages for projects 
- Makes learning new languages easier 
	- [TIOBE] Programming community
- Better understanding of significance of implementation
	- Can help in bug fixing 
- Better use of languages that are already known 
- Overall advancement of computing 
	- Examples
		- ALGOL vs Fortran

Overall to have a better understanding and have a bigger perspective in learning different kinds of programming languages and when to use them.

	- Beginner All-purpose Structure something something 
- Unstructured 
	- GOTO
Structured 
- Imperative 
- Not efficient 
- Hard coding 

OOP
- Easy application 
- Inheritance 

### Programming Domains
- Programs used in a wide variety off problem-solving domains
- The design and evaluation of a particular language is highly dependent on the domain in which it is to be used 
	- **Scientific** 
		- Fortran and AGOL 60
	- **Business Application**
		- COBOL, RPG
	- **Artificial intelligence** 
		- LSIP, Prolog, Scheme
	- **Systems programming** 
		- IBM's PLUS, Digital BLISS, UNIX
	- **Web Software** 
		- Java, PHP, JavaScript 

### Language Evaluation Criteria
- **Readability**
	- programs can be read and understood
	- can be interpreted
- **Writability**
	- language can be used to create programs in the program domain
	- what to write 
- **Reliability**
	- conformance to specifications
	- Data types
- **Cost**
	- the total cost
- **Other**
	- Portability
	- generality 
	- well-defined
