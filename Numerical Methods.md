Intermediate value theorem for continous functions 
- THeorem Intermediate - vlaue theorem for continous functions 
- Let f(x) be continous function on the interval [a,b]. If f(x) <= a <= f(x) for some number a and some x is an element [a,b]m then a = f(e) for some e elelment [a,b]

The mean value theorem 
- Similar to the intermediate vlaue theorem 

Rolle's theorem 
- Let f(x) be continous on the interval [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b). If a f(a) = f(b) = 0, then f'(e) = 0, for some e element of (a,b)

Mean value theorem for Derivatives 
- If f(x) is continous on the (closed and finite) interbal [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b) then 

Mean value theorem -- (f(b) - f(a))/(b-a)

Extreme value theorem 
- If f(x) is contionous on the close and finite interval [a,b], then c1, c2 e [a,b]  exist with f(c1) <= f(x) <= f(c2) for each x element of [a,b]. If f(x) is differentiable on (a,b) then the number c1 and c2 occur either t the endpoints of [a,b] or where f'(x) is zero.
