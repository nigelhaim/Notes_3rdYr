## Business Information Systems

- The old way:
  - Administrative staff used office systems
  - Operational people used operational systems
  - Middle managers used decision support systems
  - Top managers used executive information systems
- The “now” way
  - All employees use office productivity systems
  - Operations users require decision support systems

## A new set of system definitions

- Enterprise computing systems
- Transaction processing systems
- Business support systems
- Knowledge management systems
- User productivity systems

## Enterprise Computing

- Information systems that support company-wide operations and data management requirements
- Examples:
  - Wal-Mart’s inventory control system
  - Boeing’s production control system
  - Hilton Hotels’ reservation system
- Applications called enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provide cost-effective support for users and managers throughout the company

## Transaction Processing

- Transaction processing (TP) systems process data generated by day-to-day business operations
  - Examples:
    - Customer order processing
    - Accounts receivable
    - Warranty claim processing
- A TP system verifies customer data, checks customer credit, checks stock status, posts to accounts receivable, adjusts inventory levels, and updates the sales file

![Sales Transaction](<ImageURL>) A single sales transaction consists of six separate tasks, which the TP system processes as a group.

## Business Support

- Provide job-related information support to users at all levels of a company
  - Can work hand-in-hand with a TP system
  - New development is RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
  
![RFID Tracking](<ImageURL>) With an RFID tag, items can be tracked and monitored throughout the shipping process.

## Knowledge Management

- Uses a large database called a knowledge base
- Allows users to find information by entering keywords
- Uses inference rules, which are logical rules that identify data patterns and relationships

## User Productivity

- Technology that improves productivity
- Groupware

## Systems Integration

- Most large companies require systems that combine transaction processing, business support, knowledge management, and user productivity features

## What Information Do Users Need?

![Organizational Model](<ImageURL>) A typical organizational model identifies business functions and organizational levels.

- Top Managers
  - Develop long-range strategic plans, which define the company’s overall mission and goals
  - Need information on economic forecasts, technology trends, competitive threats, and governmental issues
- Middle Managers and Knowledge Workers
  - Provide direction, necessary resources, and performance feedback to supervisors and team leaders
  - Need more detailed information than top managers

## Supervisors and Team Leaders

- Oversee operational employees and carry out day-to-day functions
- Need decision support information, knowledge management systems, and user productivity systems

## Operational Employees

- Rely on TP systems to enter and receive data they need to perform their jobs
- Need information to handle tasks and make decisions previously made by supervisors

## Modeling

- Business model
- Requirements model
- Data model
- Object model
- Network model
- Process model

![Systems Development Tools](<ImageURL>) Microsoft Visio allows you to drag and drop various symbols and connect them to show a business process.

## Prototyping

- Early working version of an information system
- Speeds up the development process significantly
- Important decisions might be made too early, before business or IT issues are thoroughly understood
- A prototype based on careful fact-finding and modeling techniques can be an extremely valuable tool

## Computer-Aided Systems Engineering (CASE) Tools

- Provide an overall framework for systems development and support a wide variety of design methodologies such as:
  - Structured analysis
  - Object-oriented analysis
- Can generate program code, which speeds the implementation process

## Structured Analysis

- Traditional method for developing systems
- Organized into phases
- Time-tested and easy to understand
- Uses phases called the systems development life cycle (SDLC)
- Predictive approach
- Uses process models to describe a system graphically

![Visible Analyst Screen](<ImageURL>) This Visible Analyst screen shows a process model for a school registration system. The REGISTER STUDENTS process accepts input data from two sources and transforms it into output data.

- The SDLC model usually includes five steps:
  1. Systems Planning
  2. Systems Analysis
  3. Systems Design
  4. Systems Implementation
  5. Systems Security and Support

![Waterfall Model](<ImageURL>) Development phases and deliverables are shown in the waterfall model. The circular symbols indicate interaction among the phases.

## Systems Planning

- Systems request – begins the process and describes problems or desired changes
- Purpose of this phase is to perform a preliminary investigation – a critical step
- Key part of preliminary investigation is a feasibility study

## Systems Analysis

- Build a logical model of the new system
- Perform fact-finding techniques
- Build business models, data and process models, and object models
- Deliverable is the system requirements document

## Systems Design

- Create a physical model that satisfies all documented requirements
- Design user interface
- Identify outputs, inputs, and processes
- Deliverable is the system design specification
- Management and user involvement is critical

## Systems Implementation

- New system is constructed
- Programs are written and tested
- System is installed
- Deliverable is a completely functioning and documented information system

## Object-Oriented Analysis

- Combines data and the processes that act on the data into things called objects
- Objects are members of a class, which is a collection of similar objects
- Built-in processes, called methods, can change an object’s properties
- O-O methodology provides easy transition to O-O programming languages like Java

![Object-Oriented Analysis](<ImageURL>) The PERSON class includes INSTRUCTOR and STUDENT objects, which have their own properties and inherited properties.

## Agile Methods

- Newest development technique as systems are developed incrementally
- A series of prototypes are built and adjusted to meet user requirements
- As the process continues, developers revise, extend, and merge earlier versions into the final product
- Agile method emphasizes continuous feedback
- Iterative development
- Agile community has published the Agile Manifesto
- Spiral model

## Other Development Methods

- Teams consist of IT staff, users, and managers
  - Joint Application Development (JAD)
    - Focuses on team-based fact-finding
  - Rapid Application Development (RAD)
    - A compressed version of the entire development process

## Systems Development Best Practices

- Develop a project plan
- Involve users and listen carefully to them
- Use project management tools to identify tasks and milestones
- Develop accurate cost and benefit information

# DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

## The Pyramid Model

### Types of Information Processed at different levels
Common types of Information System in an organization

### 1. TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEMS

- Operational-level systems at the bottom of the pyramid
- Usually operated directly by shop floor workers or front line staff
- Provide key data required to support the management of operations
- Data obtained through automated or semi-automated tracking of low-level activities and basic transactions
- TPS are ultimately little more than simple data processing systems.

#### Functions of a TPS in terms of data processing requirements

# METHODOLOGIES FOR SYSTEMS ANALYSIS

## QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

- What are the various approaches to developing Information Systems?
- Is there one best way?
- What is the difference between techniques, methodologies, and tools?
- What does the popular term “SDLC” actually mean?

## SDLC: SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

- **SDLC** stands for Systems Development Life Cycle.
- SDLC is a life cycle or a series of stages that all systems naturally undergo.
- The primary stages include conception, development, maturity, and decline.
- Refers to the development stage of the system’s life cycle.

## METHODOLOGIES

- Is there a difference between the term SDLC and the term ‘methodology’?
- SDLC refers to a stage all systems naturally undergo.
- A methodology refers to an approach invented by humans to manage the events naturally occurring in the SDLC.
- A methodology is a set of steps, guidelines, activities, and/or principles to follow in a particular situation.

## SDLC VS. METHODOLOGY

- The term SDLC is frequently used synonymously with the waterfall or traditional approach for developing information systems.
- "THE WATERFALL APPROACH":
  - Linear sequence of stages: planning, analysis, design, implementation.
  - Revisiting prior stages is not permitted.

## EVOLUTIONARY OR SPIRAL METHODOLOGY

- **SPIRAL DEVELOPMENT**:
  - Combination of waterfall methodology and prototyping.
  - Focus on risk assessment.
  - Break the project into smaller segments.
  - Controls the impact of change.
  - Each cycle includes the same stages as identified in the SDLC model.

## APPROACHES TO SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT

### Process-Oriented Approach

- Focus on flow, use, and transformation of data.
- Involves creating graphical representations like data flow diagrams.
- Data are tracked from sources through intermediate steps to final destinations.
- Natural structure of data is not specified.

### Data-Oriented Approach

- Depicts the ideal organization of data independent of usage.
- Data model describes kinds of data and business relationships.
- Business rules depict how the organization captures and processes data.
- Create User Stories.

### Object-Oriented Approach

- Define the objects that are part of the system first.
- Identify use cases; what happens and responses to actions.
- Build the remainder of systems once use cases are identified.

## SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

- Every methodology has roughly the same stages.
- Usually, stages include Project Identification and Selection, Project Initiation and Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Maintenance.

## ADDITIONAL METHODOLOGY TYPES

### Prototyping

- Building a scaled-down working version of the system.
- Advantages: Users are involved in design, captures requirements in concrete form.

### Rapid Application Development (RAD)

- Utilizes prototyping to delay producing system design until after user requirements are clear.

### Joint Application Design (JAD)

- Users, managers, and analysts work together for several days.
- System requirements are reviewed.
- Structured meetings.

### Agile Methods

- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Individual and collective ownership, continuous integration, and customer involvement.
- **Scrum (Agile)**: Iterative and incremental agile software development framework.
- **Kanban (Agile)**: Visualize work, limit work in progress, and maximize flow.

### Rational Unified Process

## STAGES OF THE SDLC

1. Project Identification and Selection
2. Project Initiation and Planning
3. Analysis
4. Design
5. Implementation
6. Maintenance

## PHASES OF THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

1. Project Identification and Selection
   - Identification of need
   - Prioritization and translation of need into a development schedule
2. Project Initiation and Planning
   - Formal preliminary investigation
   - Presentation of reasons for system development
