- Final project would be tackling a machines learning problem and analyzing the results of the model 
- the expected output is code and paper detailing the method experiments and results 

One of the main issues in handling data
- Many source
- Messy data 

## Data warehouse
- central repository off integrated data
	- AVOID Stored in different file types (Excel, SVG, txt)
	- single source of truth
- backbone for reporting, data analytics, decision support
	- Reporting
		- Helps in decision making
		- Mostly in the form of dashboards
		- Example 
			- Netflix on genres
	- Data analytics
		- Gathering insight from the reported data
		- Interpretation of data 
		- Examples 
			- Number of active users
	- Decision support 
		- Decision making of the organization/company

### "One of the most important assets of any organization is its information. "

#### Why is Data warehouse important?
- Ensure consistency
	- Standardize data from different sources
	- reduces the risk of error
	- Application of uniform format 
- Make better decisions 
	- improving the speed and efficiency of accessing different data sets 
- Improve their bottom line 
	- Quickly access their organizations historical structures and evaluate initiatives that have been successful or unsuccessful in the past. 
	- Does the promo work in the past?

Themes
- "We collect tons of data, but we can't access it."
- "We need to slice and dice the data in every which way."
- "Business people need to get the data easily"
	- Easy interpretation of data even the ones who cannot understand the technicality behind.
- "Just show me what is important"
- "We spend entire meetings arguing about who has the right number rather than making decisions."
- "We want people to use information to support more fact-based decision making."


Data must make the information easily accessible 
- Understandable 
- Obvious 
- To anyone 

Data must presented information consistently 
- Credible 
- easily manipulated 
- cleansed
- quality assured 

Data must adapt to change
- Since data are all subject to change......data is needed to be 
- Handle inevitable chance gracefully
- Does not invalidate existing data or applications

Data must present information in timely way 
- Raw data needed to be converted into actionable information within a specific amount of time 

Data must be secure bastion that protects the information assets 
- crown jewels are stored in the data warehouse 

Data must serve as the authoritative and trustworthy foundation for improved decision making 
- right to support decision making 
- decisions that are based on the analytic evidence presented 

Data must be accepted by the business community to deem it successful 
- built an elegant solution using best-of-breed products and platforms. 

By definition 

Databases
- Online  transactional processing 
	- Delete, insert, replace and update 
Data Warehouses 
- Online analytical processing 
	- Analyze massive volumes of data rapidly 
	- Look at your data from different points of view
