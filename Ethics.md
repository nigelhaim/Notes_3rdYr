### Philosophers - After the Dark

### Activity 1 - Web of Whys
- Do not look for perfection, but look for progress
	- Progress is moving forward towards a goal through improvement 
		- Makes us to become better people
	- If everything is perfect then there is no need of progress of improvement
		- Improving helps us realize to how become better for oneself and to others
		- Improving helps us find our own uniqueness
	- We should not stop improving to make progress
		- There is always a flaw in the system
- We do not learn for school, but  for life  (Non scholae sed Vitae Discimus)
	- Apply what is learned not brag about it
		- It is better for everyone to be in the top spot than stepping on top of them
	- Achieving for the greater good 
	- Academic credit is good, but sharing and practicing is better
	- One should study to have a better life not for validation
- It is important to draw wisdom from many different places
	- Be open to new knowledge is a virtue 
	- Share, but do not force your beliefs to others 
	- Listen more than talking
		- Listening is the first step of gaining wisdom from others
- Failure is only the opportunity to begin again
	- There is no point of starting again if it hasn't failed 
		- We are still keeping doing the right decisions 
	- Avoid failure, but it can be an option 
		- When it happens it will give you lessons of a lifetime
- There are reasons each of us are born, we have to find those reasons
	- Everyone has a purpose in this world 
		- One's purpose is his or her own uniqueness 
	- We can create or find our own destinies 
	- Our life is our mission and our story for this world

- Guide in life 
- Your philosophy

Outline 
- Ethics as philosophical discipline

- Sophia - wisdom
- Love of Wisdom
- A strong desire for wisdom and a strong desire for the world 
- To understand existence 

**Love** - Strong desire for a particular object
**Wisdom**- Correct application of knowledge

**Knowledge**

	- Experiments happens in the head 
	- Experiment in thoughts and ideas 
	- Deal with dilemmas and contradictions
##### What are the methods of Philosophy? 

**Annuluses** - Greek 
- Seeing each fiber of the thread 
- Understanding each concept 

- **Inquisitive thinking**
	- Thinking in question

	- Example: Dialogue of Plato in Justice 
- **Critical, Creative, collaborative thinking**
	- Thinking outside the box
	- Imagination
	- Talking to people, asking their thoughts
- Thought probe or experimentation 
	- Hypothesizing 

#####  What are the questions we ask in Philosophy?
------------------

We utilize Philosophical reflection in ethics to have a better understanding in morality.

---------------------------
**Epistemology**
- Knowledge 
- The realm of the unknowable 
- How do we know what we know?
- What is knowledge?
- What is truth?
- The absolute of moral actions
- The justification of absolute standards and moral codes
- What are the limits of what can be known?
**Logic**
- Study of reasoning 
- What counts as a good reason or justification? 
- Holding on beliefs and principles 
- Is it logically backed up? 
- Customary practices
- The argument is sound and unsound
- What is the structure of argumentation valid and invalid? 
**Metaphysics**
- Meta + physics
- Beyond the physical 
	- Time
	- Soul
	- Meaning of life and reality 
- What is real?
- How do we define real?
- Will there be anything perceivable without a perceiver? 
- Example: A leaf falling into the ground and nobody is there to hear it, did it make a sound?
- Relativity of morality
**Ethics**
- How ought we to live?
	- Socratic 
- What constitutes a good life?
- What is "good"?
- What is the ultimate Good?
- What is the nature of morality? 
- Is morality objective and absolute? 
- What makes right/wrong/permissible? 
- How do we know the Good?
- What is happiness? 
- Why be moral? 


The soul inside of us is naturally virtuous 
- The proper function of a human 

#### What is ETHICS?
- Branch of philosophy that deals with how we ought to live, with the idea of the Good, and with concepts such as "right" and "wrong".
- Study of morality. It is otherwise known as moral philosophy. 

##### What are the branches of ETHICS?
- **Meta-ethics** - understanding of right and wrong, a probe into concepts in ethics
	- Covers of why be moral?
	- Questions on judgements and moral semantics
	- Applies moral ontology 
	- Moral epistemology 
	- Nature of Moral statements 
- **Normative or prescriptive ethics** - a survey of ethical traditions and theories; (moral philosophy) a systematic effort to understand moral concepts and justify moral principles and  theories.
	- Discuss the different theories 
	- Moral intuition
	- Consequentialism
	- Virtue ethics 
	- Social contract theory
	- Criteria of the goodness of action 
- **Applied or value ethics** - a survey of moral problems and issues across disciplines 
- Descriptive ethics - a close comparison of observation of different moral systems, actual beliefs, customs, and principals
	- No philosophical reflection
	- Not a legitimate branch of ethics

##### Domains of ethical assessment? 
1. **Action** 
	- Right act(Permissible)
		- Obligatory 
			- Duty bound to perform
			- responsibilities 
		- Optional
			- You can choose whether to do it or not 
			- Neutral 
				- there are not wrong choices
				- Choose between apple or oranges
			- Supererogatory 
				- Actions that are out of the ordinary 
				- Praised actions even though you are not required 
				- Sacrifices 
			- Whether you choose neutral or supererogatory actions it is not wrong to do it. 
	- Wrong act (not permissible)
2. **Consequences**
	- Positive vs Negative 
3. **Character**
	- Virtue vs vice
	- Are you doing it through virtue?
4. **Motive**
	- Good vs bad 
	- Intention to be looked at 
	- Why did you do that? 
	- Are you really doing it for the people of for fame? 

## What is Morality? 
- Came from the Greek word "Mores" meaning customs or traditions
- Anything that is agreed upon a culture 
- A set of customary behaviors

##### Ethics in favor of critical morality 
| Conventional or traditional morality | Critical Morality |
| --- | --- |
| The system of widley accepted rules and principles within cultures | A system of moral principles untained by mistaken beliefs, irrationality, or popular prejudices| 
| Created within social agreements | Does not have its origin in social agreements| 
| Used by members to govern their own lives asess the actions and motivationos of others. | Can serve as the true standard for determining when conventional morality has got it right and when it has fallen into error | 
| Easily observable by an outsider and social observer  | Generated through rational argumentation and probing | 

Conventional or Traditional Morality 
- Tradition that does not matter whether it is right or wrong 
- Agreements
- Presence of hypocrisy
- Close minded 
Critical Morality 
- Pause and check if it is truly right
- Questionable agreements
- Application of logic 
- Open and accepting of changes

#### Moral Intuitions as Moral Starting Points 

- Moral Intuitions are not mere gut-feelings or emotions. 
- These are not feelings of instincts 
- Basic ethical assumptions reasonably backed up by observation, argumentation, and inquiry 
	- Observing the world before assumption 
	- Intellectual capacities 
- Fundamental in that they are either logically derived or apriori true.
	- **apriori** - Prior to the experience
	- You don't need to experience something (bad) to know how it feels. Example is agony 
	- Why would you inflict pain without justification? 
- starting point governing everyday ethical decision making
- Also known as moral principles.

## Moral Reasoning 

### What is it?
- Involves 
	- Set reasons
	- Conclusions
	- Premise -> Conclusion = Arguments 
- Not all arguments are equal good. Not al arguments end in truthful conclusions
	- Inductive arguments 
		- Do not provide a certainable conclusions
	- Deductive arguments 
		- Gives you a certainable conclusions 
- Two tests for good moral reasoning 
	- We must avoid false beliefs
	- The logic for our moral thinking must be rigorous and error-free

### Unsound argument 
- Valid; but not sound. Soundness involves both validity and the truth of the statements
- Facts -> Therefore 
- A fallacy is an unsound argument

### Examples of fallacious moral arguments 

- The error is found in the content of the argument
- **Ad hominem (attacking the person) fallacy **
	- Occurs when you try to undermine a position by attacking the person who is advancing it
	- To nullify the arguments of the person because of him/her
	- "You wouldn't understand"
- **Appeal to irrelevant emotions fallacy**
	- occurs when someone tries to convince you of a claim by playing on your emotions
	- Emotional manipulation to make an argument
		- Palusot 
- **Appeal to inappropriate authority fallacy**
	- involves relying on authority figures to substantiate a position outsider of their area of expertise
	- "Parent to a child"
	- "Governor to this people"
- **Appeal to tradition fallacy**
	- relying on customary beliefs and tradition even despite the illogicality of them
	- "It has been don this way for many years.........."
- **Strawman fallacy**
	- directs an opponent's position in a way that makes it easy to refute, therby diverting attention from the real position being advanced
	- Weak interpretation of the original argument 
	- Similar to Ad Hominem but a more twist and aggressive 
- **Appeal to ignorance fallacy**
	- Thinking that the claim is true for lack of an evidence of it being false and vice versa
	- Not yet able to prove but it does not mean its true
	- The absence of the truth does not mean it is automatically false 
- **Hasty generalization fallacy**
	- Occurs when someone illicitly draws a general lesson from only a small handful of cases 
	- Claiming without qualifiers of a certain conclusion
- **Circular Argument or Begging the question**
	- The conclusion is also the premise
- **Fallacy of Accident or Dicto Simpliciter**
	- Applying one rule to another
- **False Dilemma**
	- Entertaining one option when there are other options
- **False Analogy**
	- The analogy of the argument is not working 


### The basic rule
1. When the premises are irrelivant to draw the conclusion
2. When the premises are not enough to support the conclusion
3. When there is a misuse of the meaning of terms 
**The argument is fallacious**

## Thought Experiments
- Little fictions especially devised in order to arouse moral perpelxity and show the logicality and illogiclity of examples of oral reasoning
Involve moral reasoning and justification
**Standard procedure**
1. Construct a bizarre case (imagine a scenario)
2. Hypothesize possible solutions
3. Develop logical arguments

## Asynch on moral reasoning 
### What is moral reasoning? 

"a form of practical reasoning. It is directed to us what to do"
	- Maxwell J Smith

What should we do morally speaking
**We want o make those premises is moral**
- Right or wrong 
- Examples
	- Regulation of mountain climbing because of injuries
- John Stuart Mill's harm principle 

Requires us to engage those ethical values and those principles and have an ability to talk to one another about those principles. 

Fallacies of moral reasoning are logically incorrect ways of reasoning that attempt to persuade emotionally or psychologically.  During classroom discussions and in issue-related essays, we will labor to identifying and exposing such fallacies, in the positions articulated in our readings, in-class during our discussions, as well as in our written work.

#### Fallacies 
I.          **Ambiguity**: When we use a word or phrase in such a way that it is not clear, or can be taken in more than one way.

II.        **Genetic** **Fallacies**: These are called "abusive" because they attack the something about the source "or genesis” of the argument, instead of dealing with the merits of the argument itself.  E.g.: saying a proposal "smacks of socialism" is not dealing with the proposal itself. It is always fallacious to attack an argument because of its source.

III.       **_Ad_** _**hominem**_ (is Latin for "to the man"):  This attacks the person instead of the person's argument.  E.g.: In response to somebody saying they didn't feel right about participating in a demonstration against discrimination, some one responded, "You're a fascist without any moral sense, you just want to perpetuate racism."  Or if an energy consultant accused opponents of a nuclear power plant of being "wild-eyed fanatics."  Or is it is said that anyone who opposes administration policy is a "communist dupe."
			A.        Such tactics are often successful in drawing attention away from reasoned arguments. 

IV.       **Invincible ignorance:**  Insists on the legitimacy of an idea despite contradictory facts.  The phrase "I don't care what you say" is a dead giveaway.  E.g., "It doesn't matter what anybody thinks, abortion is wrong."

V.        **Questionable Claim**: is a statement that cannot stand up to scrutiny, because it is too broad a claim.  Superlatives (phrases including adjectives or adverbs like always, never, best, worst) are often indicators of questionable claims. 
			A.        E.g., Every time someone is executed, violent crime decreases, therefore, capital punishment works.  (Or even): Executions reduce crime is an empirically questionable claim.

VI.       **Straw Man**: Changing another person’s position/argument into a form that is easier to attack.  (The metaphor is about setting up a "straw man" argument and then knocking it down.)

VII.      **Is / Ought:** Trying to derive a moral statement from a factual statement.  Assuming because something is, it ought to be.

VIII.    **Inconsistency**: Contradicting one’s own argument. 

IX.       **Begging the question:**  answering the question with a question or a variation of the same question; or just assuming that a statement what must be proved is true, in such a way as to make it seem more plausible. 
			A.        Circular arguments: e.g. How do you know God exists?  Because the Bible says so.  How do you know the Bible speaks truth?  Because it is inspired by God.

X.        **Argument from ignorance**: Insists a argument is true unless it is proved false, or false until proved true.  "Since there is no clear evidence that [someone] knew about the bribe, he must be innocent."

XI.       **Appeal to authority:**  
			A.        80% of Americans polled are against abortion, so it clearly is wrong.
			B.        The President has more information than we do, so he must have good reason for his decision.

  

XII.     **Provincialism:** Sees things exclusively through the eyes of one's own group, organization, nation, etc.  (Most moral arguments that emphasize the protection of one's own preferred group fall into this fallacy.)

XIII.    **Hasty conclusion:** Moral conclusions based on insufficient evidence:
			A.        E.g., conclusions based on anecdotal instead of thoroughly researched views of the facts.  Often includes a failure to consider pertinent and available science.

XIV.    **Two wrongs make a right:** Everybody is doing it.  The statement to the cop: Why don't you chase and ticket that other vehicle – it was going faster than I was.

XV.     **Fallacies of Faulty Causation:**
			A.        **Causal oversimplification:**  Correlation does not = causation.  Association does not mean that something has a causal impact.
			B.        **Slippery slope:** if one particular undesirable thing happens, it will inevitably lead to an even worse consequence, will lead to yet another worse consequence, and so on, on a “slippery slope” to some horror. It is the inevitability of the assumption that is fallacious; these are also forms of the questionable claim fallacy.

1.         E.g.: If you take that first drink you will become a destitute drunk.

## Ethics, and moral reasoning 

### Logical Reasoning 
- It is the study of truths and inferences
- Inferences - made between facts and statements 
	- Generate true information
	- Derived from premises

### Reasoning 
- the capability of the brain to take inputs from all the 5 senses and actually make sense out of it
"What are the standards any reasoning must follow if it is to be good reasoning?"
	- Aristotle

#### Inference Rules

"A well-reasoned argument is one that preserves the truth"

X Fallacies (Both in form and content) x barriers to logically 

Affirming the consequent 


![[Pasted image 20230925185400.png]]

### Three Laws of Thought (Aristotle)
1. An object is what it is. (Law of identity)
2. A cannot be both A and B. (Law of contradiction or no proposition can be both true and not true)
3. Every stablemen is either true or false; there is nothing in between. (Law of excluded middle)

## Barriers to Logicality 
- bias 
- rejudice 
- egocentrism
- sociocentrism 
- narrowmindedness 
- unwarranted assumption 
- wishful thinking 
- emotionality 

#### Biases 
- Playing favorites 
-  being biased towards **OR** against specific sources of information
- gets in the way of the truth
#### Prejudice 
- Pre-judgement of cases
- compared to bias, prejudice entertains preconceived notions about something, someone, etc.

#### Egocentrism 
- Found on people that they are the central source 
- He/she is the only truth 
#### Sociocentrism
- The group believes they are the central source 
- a bigger form of ego centrism 
- So committed and invested on the group 

#### Narrowmindedness
- Narrowpit thinking 
- Entertaining only the information encountered 
- Picking of information 

#### Unwarranted assumption
- Gut feeling 
- Knowing something without evidence 


#### Wishful thinking 
- Placebo effect 
- Cannot change the truth or falsity just by believing the claim

#### Emotionality 
- Inappropriate emotions
- Pitiness
- Emotional manipulation


## Intellectual standards for logic 

#### Clarity 
- gateway standard 
- Do you know what you're talking about? 
- Ambiguity or vagueness? 
- If you don't know what you're talking about then your information wont be precise, accurate, relevant, consistent, logical correct, complete, fairness


#### Precision 
- The right amount of details 
- Youre at the right EXACT location but your friend is late 

#### Accurate information 
- Free from flaws/error/mistakes 
- No falsity 
- Truthful 
- Youre at the right EXACT location and time?????


**Accurate information can be precise but precise information cannot be accurate**


#### Relevance 
- Your premises should be connected to your conclusion
- Be strict and firm on its logical standards
- Ano ba ang connection niya? 

#### Consistency 
- Are you not contradicting yourself 
- Are you consistent

#### Logical correctness
- Are your arguments structured?
- Pattern of standard and good reasoning 
- The rules of inferences applied
- Test of validity 
- IF your premises is true and valid then it CANNOT be false 

#### Completeness
- To justify conclusions
- Find a way to look for all possible information to support your thought/claim 
- Kung alam mo may false belief ka then allow yourself to correct it
- Looking at all the sides of the problem 
- NEVER STOP LOOKING FOR INFORMATION 

#### Fairness
- WALAA AKO NA KUHA KAY MAM 
- Assess it generously 
#### Charity 
- Corner principle of logic
- Never interpret the argument 
- Don't use it to your advantage 
- Collection of statements that expose truth 
- Opinions
- Be fair in picking the source 
- Be open to others 

### The truth Test 
- Sound/good arguments are structurally and **substantially** accurate.
1. Do your premises have evidentiary support? 
2. Do they correspond to facts? 



Generalized P -> Specific C = Composition

Specific P -> Generalized C = Division 


### The validity test
- Sound/Good arguments are **Structurally** and substantially accurate
1. Identify all of an argument's premises
2. Imagine that all of them are true.
3. Then, ask yourself this question: Supposing that all of the premises were true, could the conclusion be false? If yes, the argument is invalid 



## Logic, Thus, Is Truth Preservation 

### Deductive reasoning 
Test of basic truth derivation in logic: 
Tell what conclusion may be derived from the following premises:

1. If A, then B. A, therefore, **B**.
2. If A, then B. Not B, therefore, **Not A**.
3. If A, then B. If B, then C. Therefore, **A -> C**.
4. Either A or B. Not A. Therefore **B**.
5. If Tarragona is in Europe, then Tarragona is not in China. Tarragona is in Europe. Therefore, **Tarragona is not in China**. 
6. Most Filipinos are fun-loving. Linda is a Filipino. Therefore, **Linda is probably fun-loving**. 
7. Roughly 90% of the Filipino population is literate. Juan, a Filipino, is **highly likely literate**. 
8. 78% of Filipinos are already vaccinated. Thus, everyone in class **could be vaccinated**.



## Moral Relativism 
- Broad ethical theory that encompasses different idea 
- There is no absolute or objective morality 
- Morality is relative to the particular standpoint 
- Complete opposites to moral objectivism

X is Good 

Descriptive relativism 
- Empirical awareness on disagreements 
- Morality changes on every group/culture 

Cultural Relativism 
- Emphasizes that culture is the defining factor of moral judgements 
- Everything we do is moral depending on how we adapt on culture 
- Ex 
	- On one culture Monogamy is moral and polygamy is immoral and on another culture its the vice versa 
	- Contraception -> Responsible or Sin 

"The truth or falsity of moral judgements are sole based on the culture there are no grounds"

"No universal truth therefore there is no objectively right or wrong. It is only relative to the particular culture"


#### Strengths
1. Explains why moral disagreements exists
	- Huge issue of ethicists 
	- Why do cultures disagree so much 
	- Why there are so many moral clashes 
	- There is no moral truth there is no moral objectivity 
2. Existence of cultural diversity 
	- Cultural diversity has no one moral code
	- We can learn to respect and learn from one to another 

#### Problems 
1. We can still have absolute moral truths but we still haven't discovered 
	- It is a mistake that humanity should have discovered the absolute truth
	- Even there are moral disagreements doesn't mean there is no absolute moral truth
2. Moral Relativists exaggerate just how much cultures differ in terms of morality 
	- There are more moral similarities than differences 
	- Ex
		- Murder is evil 
		- Theft is evil 
3. Would a moral relativist form the old age agree on the standards of the new moral relativists of this age?
	- Ex
		- Slaves are good in the old age but right now it is not 

### Ethical Subjectivism 
- The truth or falsity of moral judgements depends solely on the attitude of a person 
- Moral relativism refined on the individual 


### Moral Skepticism 
- If two people look at the same act and at the same time and they contradicted to each other ethical subjectivism says they are right but one should only be right 
- Ex
	- It is raining the one says it is raining the other says it is not 

>[!Note]- Rain example
>![[Pasted image 20231016162106.png]]

### Can be morality be relative and objective? 
- Morality is a blend is a blend of relative and objectivism

>[!Note]- Fundamental of moral objective moral truths
>The projection of happy and moral life and the elimination of pain and suffering 
>![[Pasted image 20231016162213.png]]

We can promote life freedom and happiness because of our differences in cultures for example different cultures eliminates pain and suffering through agreeing that murder is evil, but Monogamous and polygamous makes different couples happy depending on the cultures and beliefs


## Objective relativism 
- Learning is a process of getting my perceptions to match with reality 
- Moral feelings -> Are those feelings connected to anything that is real? 
	- Yes -> Moral Objectivist 
	- No -> Moral Relativist 

### Moral Fact
- The concept of morality is the same concept of health 
- It is hard to define in a precise manner it is nonetheless intelligible concept that allows us to determine between two obvious things 

### Needs Distinctions
#### Diversity Thesis (Cultural Relativism) 
- Contrary views of different cultures 
- Different cultures have different values 

|Culture A | Culture B | 
|-|-|
|It is a moral duty to benefit an elderly person by taking her life when she gets old | It is morally forbidden to take the life of an elderly person. |
| It is morally permissible to promote racism and segregation | Racism is morally wrong, no matter the motivation and cause. | 

#### Dependency Thesis 
- Morality is the set of common rules, habits, and customs that have won social approval overtime, so that they seem part of the nature of things, as facts. There is nothing mysterious or transcendent about these codes of behavior. They are the outcomes of our social history. 

**Combining these thesis many argue that this is the foundation for ethical relativism**

If different cultures have different moral values then there is no univeral oral principles that are valid for all cultures and all times.


#### Subjective ethical Relativism (Ernest Hemingway)
- "Morality is the eye of the beholder"
- "No person can judge another person's moral views"
- "Just as different societies have different moral values, so do different individuals"
- IF this is true then:
	- Is Hitler as moral as Gandhi? 
	- Is judging another person just as good as not judging another person? 


The only plausible form of ethical relativism would be one that grounds morality in a group or culture 

## Conventionalism 
### What makes this view attractive? 

#### Undermines 
- **Intolerance and enthocentricism**
	- It feels wrong to judge another culture's moral practices by comparing those practices to the moral sensibilities of our own culture 
	- Who says our culture is right? 
	- Couldn't they judge our moral practices by comparing them to the moral sensibilities of their culture? 
	- "If conventional relativism is accepted, then racism, genocide of unpopular minorities, oppression of the poor, slavery, and even the advocacy of war for its own sake are as equally moral as their opposites. "

#### Flaw in conventional relativism 
1. We observe that different cultures have different moral rules 
2. We conclude that no culture's set of rules are better than any other culture's set of rules. 

|Description | Prescription |
| - | - |
|Different cultures have different moral values | Different cultures ought to have different moral values. | 
| Different students provide different answers to the same math equation | Different students ought to provide different answers to the same math equation. |

- Ethical diversity does not imply ethical relativism 
- Maybe some moral systems are simply wrong. 

>[!Quote]- "There are valid rules of actions that should generally be adhered to, but that may be overridden b6y another moral principle in cases of moral conflict. "
> - Pojman, "Ethical relativism Versus Ethical Objectivism"

#### Ethical Objectivism 

**Utilitarianism** - promotes collective happiness
**Liberaltarianism** - promotes individual rights 
**Deontological**  - promotes categorical rules, regardless of consequences
**Egalitarianism** - promotes a principle of equality behind the veil of ignorance 
**Virtue Ethics** - promotes an instrumentalist view of ethics


## Subjectivism, Relativism, and Emotivism 

### Four Perspectives on Moral Judgements
#### Objectivism 
- The theory that moral truths exist and that they do so independently of what individuals or societies think of them 
- Learning is a process of getting my perceptions to match with reality. 
- Broader than just a moral theory 
- Basic common sense of learning - The process of learning through perceptions of what actually reality is (5 senses)

Perceptions                 Reality 
Moral Perceptions -> Serving in a Food Kitchen 
Moral Perceptions -> Building a house 

- That moral assessment that you made is good 
- Morality its not just on thoughts but on the physical world too 

**Is it really possible to judge one act as being morally superior to another act?**


>[!Quote]- If you reject moral objectivism 
>"Then racism, genocide of unpopular minorities, opression of the poor, slavery, and even the advocacy of war on its own sake are as equally moral as their opposites"

- You cannot reject moral objectivism, and rationally argue for your moral ideals 

Implications: 
- Moral disagreements can be resolved using reasoning 
- Moral Judgements and actions can be evaluated according to universal standards.

## Moral Objectivism and Relativism 

| Descriptive Relativism | Meaethical Relativism | Normative Relativism | 
|-|-|-|
|One can observe different moral norms | There are no universal or extra-cultural moral truth | We have to "live and let live" | 

**Descriptive relativism -> Metaethical Relativism -> Normative Relativism** 

### Why people think morality is relative?
- It is considered relative because people love **tolerance**
- There are a lot of  moral disagreements 
	- Each place has their own practices and beliefs 
	- When there are agreements there is also contradiction
	- It depends on where you are coming from 
- To each his own 
	- Your life, your rules 
	- If you want to do this against your body? So be it
- Self-governance 
	- govern yourself sometimes irrationally

**Tolerance** - the basic structure of building communities 

### Relativism 
- Moral rightness and wrongness of action varies from society to society (Cultural Relativism or Conventionalism), from person to person (Subjective).
	- Cultural or conventionalism - Applies to groups 
	- Subjectivism - Personal (Deciding for yourself)
- There are no absolute universal moral standards binding on all men at all times
	- Applies to everyone 


#### Pros and Cons of Moral Relativism 
**Pros**
1. Promotes tolerance, acceptance, and respect for cultural diversity
	- Accept people of who they are and what they do
2. Validates emotions and personal preference
	- Respect on diversity 
	- People have different emotions 
	- Any moral statement is translatable of feelings and emotions 
	- Its morethan emotions and feelings 
**Cons**
1. Ethnocentric and conventionalist
	- What I see is right, it is right
	- I only tolerate you but I still think mine is still true
	- Ethnocentrism - Belief of ones culture is superior than others 
	- Conventionalism
		- Appealing to tradition 
		- Your position cannot be criticized 
	- Epistemological relativism
		- Respect each others opinions
		- That is the truth for them 
2. Eradicates the idea of good 
	- Gusto lang nila 
	- Trip lang nila 
3. Pretentious of moral infallibility
	- They can decide for themselves 
	- Somebody who never makes mistakes 
	- You don't behave without affecting others 
4. Anarchistic and Individualistic 
	- This is my territory 
	- There is no act that there is no consequences 
5. Contradictory basic claim 
	- There is no absolute truth 
	- There is no one standard 
	- Being objective

## Objectivism 
**There is absolute truth the opposite of relativism**
- There are universal and objective moral principles valid for all people and social events 

### Main arguments for Moral Objectivism 
1. It asserts that moral laws can be discovered through reason. (The Natural Law theory)
2. . It Emphasizes that there are common basic objective moral principles and virtue
	- Examples 
		- Respect for the sanctity of life 
			- We only have one life 
			- 1 life -> Precious, rare, and unique
		- Respect for freedom and autonomy 
			- Life comes with possessions 
			- Everyone has the capacity to reason
			- Basic principles 
		- Equals must be treated equally
			- Equals are equal 
			- Whatever you do the first one should also be treated the other one in the same way
		- Justice, temperance, prudence, compassion, honesty, integrity, etc. ]
			- These ideas must be valued across cultures 

**There may be more than one way 4of interpreting how these principles are applied in different contexts, but the same principles undergird them all.** 
- Everything may be present across cultures but we view them in different ways 
- Interpreting Justice, temperance, prudence, compassion, honesty, integrity, etc. in different ways

## Does the end justify the means? 

### Teleological Theory

"The greatest good for the greatest number of people"

Domain of ethical assessment: **CONSEQUENCE**
**TELOS or TELOS** = ENDGOAL OR END CONSEQUENCES, IMPACT, EFFECTS, PURPOSE 

- An act is neither good nor bad 
- The "end" or consequences make the act right or wrong. (Consequentialist/Hedonic Principles)
- Utilitarianism is the most common consequentialist or teleological moral theory 
- There are two variants: **act utilitarianism** or **rule utilitarianism**
- **Classical (Henonic/Eudamonic) utilitarians** think that benefits and harms can be characterized in more than one way. (Happiness or pleasure)
- Basic question: What actions or pleasure and minimize pain or suffering?


### Different Utilitarian Perspectives 

#### Each action produces good or bad consequences
- Good or bad or does not benefit 
- Even if we want to be neutral 
#### Direct and Indirect consequences
- Consequences that we see that we can achieve
- There are consequences we have no control off 
#### Pleasure or happiness is the only intrinsic good
- We pursue for the sake for itself is pleasure or happiness
- True happiness not just joy

#### Pleasure and pain can be quantified (Jeremy Bentham)

#### Pleasure and pain come in different forms. (John Stuart Mill)

#### The betterment of the society is the ultimate aim 
- It is not the happiness of one 

#### Everyone's happiness counts equally

#### There are general actions or rules that maximize utility

#### Actual Consequences 
- Life resuscitated 
- Pleasure of family 
- Pleasure of the person saved 
- Less trauma 
- Pain will be minimized 

#### Foreseeable Consequences 
- The person may go back to his job or profession
- The society may improve and benefit from the person's work 

**Saving a drwoning person**
**But what if the person ends up becoming a murderer?**

### Act Utilitarianism versus Rule Utilitarianism 

#### Act Utilitairianism
- Specific acts generate the greater good 
- Example: 
	- Pharmaceutical companies releasing drugs that have been governmentally approved but with known minor side effects because the drug is able to help more people 
#### Rule Utilitarianism 
- There are rules that maximize the good 
- Example:
	- Airlines selling tiered tickets/services (economy, business, first class seats) to accommodate those who cannot afford upper-class seats. More people are able to fly. 

### Felicific or Bentham's Calculus 
- The pleasure derived form drinking beer is more intense than the pleasurable derived from reading Rizal's novels (intensity)
- The pleasure of drinking beer lasts longer than the pleasure derived from Rizal's novels (duration)
- We are confident and sure that drinkning beer is more pleasurable than reading Rizal's novels (certainty)
- The beer is closer to us than the novel's setting., and therefore it is easier for us to access the former than the latter (proximity)
- Drinking beer is more likely to promote more pleasure in the future than reading Rizal's Novels (Fecundity)
- Drinking beer is pure pleasure compared to reading Rizal's novels which are mixed with something else (purity)
- Drinking beer affects both myself and my friends and so has a greater extent. (extent)


### Limitations 
- Consequences cannot be predicted all the time. The results of our act9ions happen in the future 
- Utilitairanism has trouble accounting for justice and individual rights
- Happiness is not the only commodity worth considering 
- Happiness is oftentimes subjective
